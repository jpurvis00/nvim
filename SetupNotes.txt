The following are some notes on setup and config for neovim and plugins.
A lot of this has been a fight to get working, so I'm documenting it here.
I'm new to neovim/lua and the whole ecosystem, so I'm sure there are better 
ways to do some of this.

Sql notes:
- I'm using MSSQL.
- I tried setting up and using nvim-dadbod, nvim-dadbod-ui, and nvim-dadbod-completion.
    I never could get nvim-dadbod-completion to work, so I gave up on it. Not sure what I was doing wrong.
- I've decided that nvim-dadbod-ui is not going to work for me. It is setting the width of the column in the
    results set to the width of the column definition(nvchar(250)). If my first 1 or 2 columns has this, I can't see
    the rest of the results without scrolling.
- I found that I can use sqls-server and sqls.nvim to get better results. One caveat to this is that you
    need to create an sql file and use that to run your queries.
    - ***** Sqls* commands were not avaiable at first. I installed the sqls-server first and didn't
        realize that you needed to install sqls.nvim to get to the commands.
    - For sqls-server, I had to install go using chocolatey. Then install sqls-server using go install.
    - There is config in the lspconfig.lua and I created sqls.lua for additional config. Possibly could 
        have put it all in one file but still too new to this to know for sure.
    - In order to get multiple connections setup, I had to put them in a config file. This is done so that 
        I can keep my connection information out of my git repo. According to the 
        docs(https://github.com/sqls-server/sqls?tab=readme-ov-file), one option is to put the connections
        in a config.yml file. The default dir for this is $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sqls/config.yml. $XDG_CONFIG_HOME
        parses out to $HOME/.config/

Initial setup notes:
- Followed along with this video for initial setup: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pAG3BHurdM
- Using Mason(:Mason) to install lsp's/linters/formatters/dap adapters. This is a package manager for neovim.
- Using Lazy(:Lazy) to install plugins. This is a package manager for neovim. 

ToDo's:
- Need to look into Git integrations: fugitive, git-blame, git-messenger, gitlinker
